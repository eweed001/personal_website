      Hello everyone! My name is Emily and I am a Junior at Cornell University.
      I am from Rochester, N.Y. but currently reside in Ithaca. I am studying
      Statistical Science with a minor in Computer Science.
      My main interests lie in the world of data science / analytics.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not doing my schoolwork I like to be outside, hike, read, play
      volleyball and cook. I am lucky to live in Ithaca where the hiking trails
      are seemingly endless. My favorite genre of books to read is mystery and horror
      but I will pick up pretty much anything when I'm looking for a new book.
      Some of my most recent favorites have been <em>The Woman in the Window</em>
      by A.J. Finn and <em>Pet Sematary</em> by Stephen King. I am a vegetarian and I
      cook a wide variety of dishes. I've also been attempting to perfect my bread
      but it takes a little practice. </p>
    <p>This summer I will be interning as a Decision Analytics Associate at a
      healthcare consulting company. I'm super excited to learn all I can and
      spend the summer in Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p> Feel free to explore my other pages (resume, hobbies and one devoted to my
      dog). Thanks for visiting!
