    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>Living in my own apartment off campus has forced me to become better at
      cooking for myself consistently. Especially now that all my classes are
      online, I don't go to campus nearly as much as I did previously. Thus I
      eat pretty much all my meals at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been a vegetarian my whole life so I don't cook with meat. I eat
      a lot of stir fry and pasta dishes but always try to pick different
      recipes to try out. Some of my recent favorite recipes have been a Sundried
      Tomato and Gnocchi dish, Spicy Kale Potato Bowls, and Thai Green Curry.
      I don't really have a favorite type of cuisine. Pretty much just make whatever
      I have the ingredients for! If you have any recipes you've made recently
      you feel so inclined to share I would really appreciate it. I'm always
      looking for new thing!
    </p>

    <h2>Houseplants</h2>
    <p>
      I've worked at a garden center for the past three summers and to say that
      it has fueled my obsession with houseplants would be an understatement.
      I'm pretty sure it started it. If I had to estimate I would say I have over
      30 plants (not all in my apartment though).
    </p>
    <p>
      I like watching them grow and searching for new ones that I don't have yet.
      When I first started buying plants I didn't know a whole lot, just bought
      ones that I thought were pretty. Once a few died on me I started doing more
      research and now I have more knowledge about houseplants than I ever thought
      I would. There's always more to learn and I love finding new plants that I
      didn't know existed. I had no idea how expensive some rare houseplants can
      get (upwards of $300 for just a cutting). I'm not sure if I trust my plant
      parenting skills yet to buy one of those.
    </p>

    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>
      I started reading again for enjoyment for the first time since grade
      school two summers ago. I was taking a longer plane ride and wanted
      something to do that wasn't staring at my phone. I picked up <em>The
        Outsider</em> by Stephen King and barely put it down until I finished
      it. Since then I've read over 30 books, squeezing as many as I can in each
      break.
    </p>
    <p>
      My two most recent finishes are <em>The Guest List</em> by Lucy Foley
      and <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> by Khaled Hosseini. Both 5 stars in
      my mind. I already have a list waiting for me for this summer but am always
      looking for new things to add to it (please give me recommendations).
      I have a Kindle so I usually
      read books I've borrowed from the library virtually but I also have begun
      to visit used book stores if I just want to browse. Sometimes you just
      can't beat reading a paperback or hardcover.
